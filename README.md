# Schibsted Frontend Exercise ![CI status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen.svg)

Technical exercise of the company Schibsted Spain, which proposes the creation of an accordion using Vanilla Javascript, Sass, ES6 and as an extra bonus, calls to an external API to generate the different sections of the accordion.

It is not allowed to use any Javascript framework.

Analyzing the proposal, I opted for the use of Custom Elements for the creation of the different elements of the DOM, since they offered me the possibility of composing the application in an efficient and reusable way.
